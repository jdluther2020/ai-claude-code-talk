## Summary

A contrarian take on the "SaaSapocalypse" narrative following Claude Opus 4.6's release. Uses Nostradamus as a framing device to explore the shortsight, foresight, and hindsight of market reactions to AI agents disrupting traditional software.

**Key Topics:**
- The "Software Winter" and IGV index decline
- The "New Riches" (infrastructure owners) vs "New Poor" (SaaS companies)
- Why the doom predictions may be premature
- The IGV Quatrain — a mock prophecy for the AI era

**Original Portmanteau:** AI-Agent-geddon

## The IGV Quatrain

```
The Gilded Index [IGV] shall reach for the sun,
Till the Silent Agent makes the many as none.
From the Cloud of Forty-Six, the iron rain falls,
And the Winter shall dwell within the empty halls.
```
