## 🚀 Workflow: Adding a New Blog Article

### Prerequisites
Gather these 3 details about the article:
1. **Article Title** (with emojis/formatting if desired)
2. **Blog Series/Context** (e.g., "Claude Code Talk", "Anthropic Developer Talk", "AI Term of the Day")
3. **Medium URL** (full link to published article)

### Step 1: Create Blog Folder
Create a folder with kebab-case name in the repo root:
```
the-future-of-agentic-coding-with-claude-code/
```

### Step 2: Create CLAUDE.md in Blog Folder
Create a `CLAUDE.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
topic: "Article Title Here (quote if it contains colons)"
context: "Blog Series Name"
reference: "https://medium.com/..."
---

Optional description/notes about the article (follows the pattern of other CLAUDE.md files)
```

**IMPORTANT GOTCHAS:**
- ⚠️ **Always quote the `topic` value** if it contains colons (`:`) — YAML requires this for special characters
- Keep description short and reference the Medium link
- Follow the pattern from other blog CLAUDE.md files in the repo

### Step 3: Add Entry to README.md
Update `README.md` at the repo root. Add entry at the **top** of `## 📚 Article Index (Newest First)`:

```markdown
* **[📟 Title Here](https://medium.com/...)** — Brief one-line description. [[Technical Assets](./folder-name)]
```

**Format Pattern:**
- Include emoji from title (if present)
- Include full title with link
- Brief description (one sentence)
- Link to local assets folder

### Step 4: Commit & Push
```bash
git add README.md the-folder-name/CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "Add new blog: [Blog Title]

- Add article to README index (newest first)
- Create CLAUDE.md for [folder-name]
- Document article metadata
