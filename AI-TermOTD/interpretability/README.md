## Summary

Interpretability is the science of understanding AI models from the inside out — reverse-engineering the black box. Anthropic's Interpretability team pioneered "mechanistic interpretability," treating neural networks like organisms to study rather than machines we designed.

**Key Topics:**
- What is interpretability? (Understanding AI from the inside out)
- Why we need it — we grow, not build neural networks
- Mechanistic interpretability — Anthropic's approach
- Chain-of-thought as a window into model reasoning
- The race: Can we understand AI before it's too powerful to audit?
